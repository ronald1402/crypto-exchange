This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, generate your application:

```bash
npx create-next-app --use-npm -e https://github.com/openware/nextjs-tailwind-ethers my-crypto-app
```

run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

## Application structure

```
- assets/images     # Local images using for next/image optimization.
- components        # Contain React components.
- contexts          # Contain React contexts.
- contracts         # Contain Smart Contract related. e.g. ABI json.
- hooks             # Contain React hooks.
- pages             # Contain application pages.
- public            # Public assets that can be loaded from the client side.
- styles            # Application styles/css
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
